### Log Aggregation

Log Aggregation enables centralized collection of logs from servers, endpoints, applications, and network devices into a single platform. This eliminates log silos and provides a unified security view.

### Event Correlation

Correlation analyzes events across multiple sources to identify patterns that would be missed when logs are reviewed individually (e.g., repeated failed logins followed by a successful login from the same host). This significantly improves threat detection accuracy.

### Visualization

Visualization presents security data through dashboards, charts, and timelines, allowing security teams and management to quickly understand risk levels, trends, and ongoing incidents.


Log management is the foundation of the iSIEM platform. It involves the centralized collection, normalization, storage, correlation, and visualization of logs from multiple sources.

### Key Capabilities:

- Collection of logs from Linux and Windows endpoints, servers, and applications

- Support for system logs, authentication logs, application logs, and security events

- Normalization of logs into a common format for easier analysis

- Event correlation to identify suspicious behavior across multiple systems

- Secure log storage with configurable retention policies

### How It Solves SME Challenges:

- Eliminates fragmented log storage across systems

- Enables faster incident detection and investigation

- Supports regulatory requirements for audit trails and log retention
- Provides enterprise-level visibility without licensing costs
