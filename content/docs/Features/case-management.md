### Case Management (TheHive)

Case management is a critical component of the iSIEM platform that ensures security incidents are handled in a structured, consistent, and auditable manner. In iSIEM, case management is implemented using TheHive, an open-source incident response platform designed to support real-world security operations.

For SMEs, case management bridges the gap between detection and response, turning security alerts into clearly tracked incidents with ownership, context, and resolution.

#### Purpose of Case Management in iSIEM

Without case management, security teams often rely on emails, chats, or spreadsheets to track incidents. This leads to:

- Lost context

- Inconsistent responses

- Poor auditability

- Difficulty proving due diligence

Case management solves this by providing a centralized system to manage the full lifecycle of a security incident—from detection to closure.

#### Core Capabilities of TheHive
Incident Creation and Tracking

- Security alerts from Wazuh are converted into cases

- Each case represents a single security incident

- Related alerts can be grouped under one case to avoid duplication

This ensures incidents are tracked as business-impacting events, not isolated alerts.

#### Structured Investigation Workflow

Each case supports:

- Defined investigation steps

- Task assignment to analysts

- Status tracking (new, in progress, resolved)

- Documentation of findings and decisions

This creates repeatable workflows that improve investigation quality and speed.

#### Collaboration and Accountability

TheHive enables:

- Multiple analysts to collaborate on a case

- Clear assignment of responsibility

- Visibility into who did what and when

This is especially valuable for SMEs where team members may have overlapping roles.

#### Evidence Collection and Audit Trail

All actions taken during an investigation are logged, including:

- Alert details

- Analyst notes

- Decisions and response actions

- Resolution outcomes

This provides a complete audit trail, which is critical for regulatory compliance, incident reviews, and management reporting.

#### Integration Within the iSIEM Ecosystem

Case management does not operate in isolation. Within iSIEM:

- Wazuh provides alerts that trigger case creation

- Threat intelligence (MISP & OpenCTI) enriches cases with context

- SOAR (Shuffle) automates case creation, updates, and response actions

- AI Assistant (Ollama) assists analysts with explanations and investigation guidance

This integration ensures that cases are context-rich and actionable.

#### Incident Lifecycle Management

Case management supports the full incident lifecycle:

- Detection – Alert generated by Wazuh

- Triage – Case created and prioritized

- Investigation – Evidence gathered and analyzed

- Containment & Remediation – Actions taken (manual or automated)

- Resolution – Incident closed with documented outcome

- Lessons Learned – Findings used to improve detections

This lifecycle approach improves maturity and repeatability.

#### Compliance and Regulatory Value

Case management directly supports compliance by:

- Demonstrating structured incident handling

- Providing documented evidence for audits

- Supporting post-incident reporting

- Enabling traceability and accountability

For SMEs under regulatory pressure, this is often a mandatory requirement, not just a best practice.

#### Value to SMEs

Implementing case management with TheHive enables SMEs to:

- Operate with SOC-level discipline

- Improve incident response consistency

- Reduce investigation time

- Prove compliance and due diligence

- Scale security operations without scaling cost
